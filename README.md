# Snowflake Generator

This script generates a sequence of 6000 images of snowflakes using the Python imaging library (PIL).

## Requirements

- Python 3
- PIL module

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script using `python snowflake_generator.py`
3. The generated snowflake images will be saved in the "images" directory.

## Customization

The size of the snowflakes and the canvas can be modified by changing the values of the `img` and `idraw` variables in the script. The number of snowflakes generated can be modified by changing the value of the `range` function in the for loop at the beginning of the script.
